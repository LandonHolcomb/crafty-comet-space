## Overview

This is a placeholder project demonstrating the format for research projects on your site. Replace this with actual project descriptions.

## Project Description

This project focuses on understanding and mitigating the trainability challenges in variational quantum algorithms, particularly the barren plateau phenomenon. Key components include:

- **Gradient Analysis**: Tools for analyzing gradient distributions in quantum circuits
- **Circuit Design**: Testing different ansatz architectures for improved trainability
- **Optimization**: Comparing classical optimizers for quantum machine learning
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots of cost landscapes and training dynamics

## Technologies

- Python 3.10+
- PennyLane / Qiskit
- NumPy, SciPy
- Matplotlib, Plotly for visualization
- JAX for automatic differentiation

## Key Features

1. Automated gradient variance computation
2. Support for multiple quantum hardware backends
3. Benchmarking suite for different circuit designs
4. Educational notebooks and tutorials

## Installation

```bash
pip install pennylane numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

```python
from trainability_tools import analyze_circuit

# Define your quantum circuit
circuit = create_vqc(n_qubits=4, depth=10)

# Analyze trainability
results = analyze_circuit(circuit, n_samples=1000)
results.plot_gradient_distribution()
```

## Results

Include key findings, plots, and insights from your research here.

## Future Work

- Extend to larger systems
- Test on real quantum hardware
- Develop mitigation strategies
- Integrate with quantum error correction
