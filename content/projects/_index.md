        Here you'll find projects related to my research in quantum computing, machine learning, and quantum algorithms. This includes implementations, experiments, and explorations in:
        
        - **Variational quantum algorithms and trainability**
        - **Quantum natural language processing**
        - **Quantum circuit optimization**
        - **Open-source tools and educational resources**
        
        *Projects will be added as they become available. I'm working on them :)*
