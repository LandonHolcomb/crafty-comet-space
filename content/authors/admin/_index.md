Landon Holcomb is a PhD student in Computer Science at Clemson University, where his research focuses on **quantum machine learning, variational quantum algorithms, and the trainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems**. He is particularly interested in bridging quantum computing with biophysics and other interdisciplinary domains.  

Before transitioning to computer science, Landon completed his MS in Physics at Clemson, where he studied computational and experimental topics in biophysics. His broader goal is to advance quantum technologies that connect theory, experiment, and real-world impact.  

Outside of research, he enjoys hiking, writing, and developing educational materials for quantum computing courses and workshops.
