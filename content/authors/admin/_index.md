## About Me

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Clemson University, where I focus on **quantum machine learning, variational quantum algorithms, and Quantum Natural Language Processing**. My research explores the intersection of quantum computing, machine learning, and algorithm design. I am particularly interested in what QML can reveal about the nature of learning and representation itself, how quantum structure may expose patterns or principles that are hidden to classical models.

Before transitioning to computer science, I completed an MS in Physics at Clemson. I'm passionate about bridging theory and application, and making quantum computing more accessible through teaching and science communication.
