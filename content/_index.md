        My research sits at the intersection of **quantum computing, machine learning, and algorithm design**. I work on:
        
        - **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**: Developing and analyzing variational quantum algorithms for machine learning tasks
        - **Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP)**: Applying quantum circuits to NLP problems using compositional approaches
        - **Trainability & Optimization**: Understanding and mitigating barren plateaus in variational quantum circuits
        - **Quantum Applications in Biophysics**: Exploring how quantum algorithms can advance computational biophysics
        
        I'm passionate about bridging theory and application, and I'm always open to collaboration on quantum computing research.
